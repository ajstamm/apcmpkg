# Green Space, Individual Air Pollutants and Risk of Birth Defects

\doublespacing

## Background

In \gls{nys}, birth defects result in 20% of deaths among infants between one month and one year old[@Mathews2015] and babies born with birth defects are ten times more likely to die before they are a year old than babies without birth defects.[@CMR2013] About 6000 children of the roughly 125,000 children born in \gls{nys} outside \gls{nyc} each year are diagnosed with birth defects before age 3.[@CMR2016] Approximately 30%-40% of birth defects have known causes related to genetics, environment, and maternal health.[@Weinhold2009; @Al-Hadithi2012] 

The connection between birth defects and maternal smoking via oxidative stress is well documented.[@Hackshaw2011; @Hoyt2016; @Vrijheid2011; @Rao2016; @Baldacci2018; @Wyszynski1997a] Some of these components are believed to cause epigenetic changes in the developing fetus and to trigger oxidative stress. Many components of cigarette smoke are also found in \gls{pm}.[@FDA2012]  
Pregnant women exposed to higher concentrations of air pollution show more markers of DNA damage that are associated with oxidative stress than pregnant women exposed to lower concentrations of air pollution.[@Nagiah2015] Given similarities between cigarette smoke and some forms of air pollution, notably \gls{pm25}, a link between air pollution and birth defects is possible.

The three birth defects investigated in this study include clubfoot, oral clefts, and craniosynostosis, which are among the more common birth defects in \gls{nys}, with over 100 cases born with each birth defect annually.[@CMR2013] They were selected because they are posited to be susceptible to oxidative stress caused by similar routes of exposure. All three birth defects have an increased risk of developing if the mother smokes[@Hackshaw2011; @Hoyt2016; @Vrijheid2011; @Rao2016; @Baldacci2018; @Wyszynski1997a] and can be diagnosed prenatally.[@Shi2018; @Helfer2016; @Nicholls2017]

Air pollution may be a risk factor for development of oral clefts, clubfoot, and craniosynostosis in the fetus. Results of research have been inconclusive.[@Rao2016; @Baldacci2018] Studies have not been directly comparable, however. They vary in whether they use monitored or modeled pollution data, size of the study area, availability of pollution data throughout the study area, and frequency of pollution measurements. 

Studies on the relationship between trees and air pollution have found that trees reduce various types of air pollution by either absorbing them (for example, \gls{co2}) or by trapping them in their leaves (for example, \gls{pm25}).[@Ozdemir2019; @Franchini2018] While trees and shrubs have been shown to remove \gls{o3} and \gls{pm25} from the air, published research on the relationship between grasses and air pollution could not be located. A 2018 literature review stated the need for more research on the connection between green space and air pollution.[@Franchini2018] Another review from 2019 found mixed results when assessing the relationship between green space and air pollution, notably for ozone.[@Eisenman2019]

Green space is poorly studied in birth defects research. The only study the authors could find focused on heart defects and concluded that increasing green space was protective against being born with a heart defect.[@Nie2020] Among birth outcomes research (mostly birthweight and preterm birth), results are mixed. Most studies occur in urban areas and rely on the \gls{ndvi}, which does not differentiate between grasses and trees. Among studies with multiple buffers, those that see an effect tend to see the same or similar protective effects for birthweight across buffers under 1000 meters.[@Ebisu2016; @TorresToda2020; @Laurent2013; @Grazuleviciene2015; @Agay-Shay2014] In urban areas, green space tends to be associated with higher birthweight and fewer preterm births, especially among women of lower education levels or socio-economic status.[@Markevych2014; @Dadvand2014; @Nichani2017]

This study explored the association between maternal exposure to \gls{pm25} and \gls{o3} during the first trimester of pregnancy using statewide time-varying data for the exposures and a statewide dataset for the outcomes from 2002 to 2015 in \gls{nys}. This study used a case-cohort design with logistic regression to determine whether green space affected the relationship between select measures of air pollution and select birth defects. 


## Methods


### Study population

Cases were identified through the \gls{nys} \gls{cmr}, as described under Chapter 2 methods. Case categories included infants born with clubfoot, infants born with cleft \lcp, infants born with cleft palate, and infants born with craniosynostosis. Controls were selected from \gls{nys} Vital Records and matched on year of birth, three controls for each case, for the birth years 2002 to 2015 with mother residing in \gls{nys} outside \gls{nyc} at time of birth.

### Exposure assessment

This study used the Downscaler air pollution model[@Berrocal2010; @Berrocal2012] described in Chapter 2. Weekly average and peak measures of modeled \gls{pm25} and \gls{o3} were calculated for the period inclusive of four weeks prior to pregnancy until week 12 of gestation. \gls{pm25} and \gls{o3} exposure were calculated from the modeled estimates of \gls{pm25} and \gls{o3}, respectively, in the census tract where the residence at birth was geocoded. 

Green space was calculated using the \gls{nlcd} for 2011[@EROS]. This year was used because it is closest to 2010, which was the year used for the Census data. For this aim, three green space measures were created, for forests, grassland, and water, as well as measures combining them. Trees actively block and absorb several kinds of air pollution, grasses are associated with other health benefits, and little research is published on the relationship between water and air pollution. The forest measure was the proportion of pixel areas in the buffer that fall into the categories of deciduous, evergreen, or mixed forests or woody and emergent herbaceous wetlands. The grassland measure was the proportion of pixel areas that fall into the categories of scrub, grasslands, pasture, and cultivation. The green measure included both forest and grassland. The nature measure included forest, grassland, and water. 

Several buffers were created around each maternal residence, including 50m, 100m, 200m, 300m, 400m, and 500m radius. From the three green space variables, two composite variables were created for use in the models. The first variable measured four categories of grasses and trees (grasses and trees below their respective medians, grasses and trees above their respective medians, grasses below their median and trees above their median, and grasses above their median and trees below their median). The second variable combined grasses and trees into a total green space variable, then measured four categories of green space and water (green space and water below their respective medians, green space and water above their respective medians, green space below their median and water above their median, and green space above their median and water below their median). 



### Statistical analysis

This study used data from Chapter 2 with the following addition. Buffers of 50m, 100m, 200m, 300m, 400m, and 500m were created around the mother's residence. Each buffer was overlaid on the simplified \gls{nlcd} grid containing the four categories grasses, trees, water, and other. Proportions were calculated for the amounts of the buffer area that fell into each category. These proportions were then linked back to the birth data using mother's residence. The full set of data that were spatially joined is shown in \@ref(fig:join).

Univariate and bivariate analyses described in Chapter 2 informed this study. The cross-basis settings described in Chapter 2 were used in the models for this study. For the multivariate analysis, a series of distributed lag logistic models were run using the R package dlnm[@Gasparrini2011] for each case group and combination of \gls{o3} and \gls{pm25}. These models have been used previously to study birth outcomes.[@Liang2016] Since an estimate of reasonable lag was not available, but people can experience both chronic and acute (same day) effects of inhaling \gls{pm25}, this study used several possible lag weeks ranging from one month before estimated conception to estimated end of first trimester, each one week apart, to cover the critical windows for the birth defects of interest.

For clarity the lag weeks were as follows, all calculated from estimated conception date. For the first run with 16 weeks, the last week of the first trimester (week 12) of pregnancy was lag 0, the week of conception was lag 12, and the week one month before conception was lag 16. For the second run with 12 weeks, lag 0 was the last week of the second month (week 8) of pregnancy, lag 8 was the week of conception, and lag 12 was the week one month before conception. The first run was intended to capture any association in the first trimester. The second run was intended to focus on the second month of pregnancy, when cranial features develop.

This approach allowed modeling of the change in values from week to week, any possible effect of exposure a few weeks prior to the critical window of weeks 3 to 12 of pregnancy, and the week during that time that shows the strongest association with each outcome.[@Adeyeye2019] Running the models using weekly peaks as well as weekly averages captured spikes in exposure that would be smoothed away (and masked) when considering an average. One set of models contained means for \gls{o3} or \gls{pm25}; the other set contained peaks for \gls{o3} or \gls{pm25}. 

Using the model settings selected in Chapter 2, the full covariate models were run with these settings to determine the significant weeks. The full models included the season of conception, since the mother may have spent more time indoors in colder months and some components of \gls{pm25} increase in colder weather while others decrease, and the \gls{pm25} measures alone would not be sufficient to capture that variation. Maternal education level and smoking were included. All categorical variables were coded as described in Chapter 2. Green space was included as either grass-tree or green-water composites for each of the six buffers. Tract-level median household income was included as a proxy for \gls{ses}. Four models were run for each case group: \gls{pm25} or \gls{o3}, with either mean or peak values. The full lagged model was as follows:

$logit(RR_{bd}) = \beta_0 + \sum{(\alpha_jAir)} + \beta_1Education + \beta_2Season + \beta_3Smoking + \beta_4Income + \beta_5Green$

- $\alpha_jAir$ = series of betas for each week of estimates for each air pollutant (\gls{pm25} or \gls{o3})
- $bd$ = birth defect (clubfoot, cleft \lcp, cleft palate, or craniosynostosis)
- $Green$ = green space measure (grass-tree composite or green-water composite)


Prediction models were used to evaluate the results. For the prediction models to calculate \gls{rr}s, the cross-prediction was centered on the point at approximately two standard deviations from the mean, as described in Chapter 2. Predictive risk ratios were calculated for 10 units above the centering value. Models were run for all combinations of air pollution measure, green space measure and buffer, and birth defect group, at both 12 and 16 weeks, as previously noted. 

Models were run the first time with iterative elimination of insignificant lags (see Appendix A: [Supplemental Tables for Chapter 3] for full results). This analysis revealed that in general, results were consistent across all buffers. When models were run a second time to include estimates for all lags, only the 300 meter buffers were run. Spatial joining of birth residences to land cover and census tracts was completed in ArcGIS.[@ESRI2016] Green space buffers were calculated in ArcGIS. All other analyses were completed in R.[@RCoreTeam2017] 



## Results


### Descriptive analysis



As described in Chapter 2 (see Table \@ref(tab:desc)), controls included 18,153 births that were conceived between February 1, 2002 and December 31, 2015 and born to mothers living in NYS outside NYC across all four case groups. Cases included 2423 births with clubfoot, 952 births with cleft palate, 1281 births with cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and 931 births with craniosynostosis after excluding genetic syndromes. Across all controls, 78.9% of mothers reported white race and 84.5% of mothers reported non-Hispanic ethnicity. Among the case groups, 82.5%-84.4% of mothers reported white race and 84.1%-87.4% of mothers reported non-Hispanic ethnicity. Across all controls, 15.4% of mothers reported smoking while pregnant; among cases, 18.6%-22.3% of mothers reported smoking while pregnant. Across all controls, 61.2% of mothers reported education above high school; among cases, 52.3%-61.5% of mothers reported education above high school. Across all controls, 28.7% of mothers reported ages between 30 and 34; among cases, 25.1%-30.0% of mothers reported ages between 30 and 34. 

As described in Chapter 2 (see Table \@ref(tab:descexp)), exposures were assigned to all cases and controls throughout the study period based on census tract of mother's residence and estimated week of conception. The mean weekly \gls{o3} mean concentration was 37.2ppb for all controls and 36.1 to 37.6ppb for the case groups. The mean weekly \gls{o3} peak concentration was 48.3ppb for all controls and 46.7 to 48.9ppb for the case groups. The mean weekly \gls{pm25} mean was 10.0\ugm for all controls and 9.8 to 10.1\ugm for the case groups. The mean weekly \gls{pm25} peak was 16.8\ugm for all controls and 16.3 to 17.0\ugm for the case groups. 

Overall, there was a lot of overlap between residences at birth with grasses and residences at birth with trees. Over half of the residences at birth had no green space for either definition within the 50m and 100m buffers for all of the case groups. Over half of the residences at birth had no grasses or water for any of the case groups within the 200m and 300m buffers. Over half of the residences at birth had no water for any of the case groups within the 400m and 500m buffers. At the 500m buffer, about 80% of residences at birth had some kind of green space around the residence. Water made up the smallest proportion of natural area, with fewer than 1% of residences at birth near water at the 50m buffer and about 25% of the residences at birth near water at the 500m buffer. Models for cleft palate at the 50m buffer containing grasses, trees, and water were excluded due to fewer than 5 cases having residences at birth within 50m of water (see Table \@ref(tab:descgrn2)).

In evaluations, chi-square tests of whether different green space types were present or not showed strong associations between grasses and trees and between green space and water for all buffer sizes. Correlation tests of proportions showed strong associations between grasses and trees for all buffers except 50m and between green space and water for the 100m and 500m buffers, with a weak association for the 200m buffer. For this reason, composite variables were created for the models. One variable categorized grasses and trees; the other categorized grasses, trees, and water.


### Multivariate Analysis

<!-- remove iterative results
As shown in Table \@ref(tab:rrcum2all), the cumulative effect of air pollution was not significantly associated with any of the birth defects studied during the period of one month prior to conception through the end of the third month of pregnancy. For most associations, in the evaluation that removed insignificant lags, the cumulative effect of the air pollutant on the risk of developing the birth defect was consistently just above or just below 1.0 for all buffers, both green space measures, and both the 12-week (one month prior to pregnancy through the end of the second month of pregnancy) and 16-week (one month prior to pregnancy through the end of the first trimester of pregnancy) evaluations, with three exceptions. 
The effects of a 10\ugm increase in \gls{pm25} mean concentrations on the risk of both cleft lip with or without cleft palate and cleft palate alone from one week to the next had a much greater diminishing effect on overall risk than for any of the other associations, though the effect was non-significant. 
The effects of a 10\ugm increase in \gls{pm25} mean and peak concentrations were consistent across buffers and green space measures, but varied between the 12-week and 16-week evaluations. 
The effect of a 10\ugm increase in \gls{pm25} mean concentrations on craniosynostosis were just below 1.0 for the 12-week evaluation and just above 1.0 for the 16-week evaluation. For \gls{pm25} peak concentrations, the effect was switched, with effect just above 1.0 for the 12-week evaluation and just below 1.0 for the 16-week evaluation. 
-->

In the 300 meter buffers evaluations with all lags, results for both green space measures were nearly identical (for results for the other buffers, see Appendix A: [Supplemental Tables for Chapter 3]). For clubfoot, the cumulative effect of \gls{o3} was higher in the 12-week evaluation than in the 16-week evaluation and the cumulative effect of \gls{pm25} was lower than \gls{o3} for all evaluations. For cleft \lcp, all cumulative effects were low for both \gls{o3} and \gls{pm25}, with cumulative effects of \gls{pm25} lower than \gls{o3}. For cleft palate, \gls{o3} mean had the highest cumulative effect in both evaluations and \gls{pm} had the lowest effect. For craniosynostosis, \gls{pm25} had a higher cumulative effect than \gls{o3} for all evaluations.

When evaluating risk during individual weeks, for most evaluations, results were similar across all buffers, so individual weeks are shown for only the 300 meter buffer. The 300 meter buffer has been used in other studies[@Grazuleviciene2015; @TorresToda2020; @Dzhambov2019; @Xiao2022], making results easier to compare across studies, and it is central in the buffer values used in this study.

\textbf{Clubfoot} 
\end{flushleft}

<!-- remove iterative results
In the stepwise elimination evaluations, which were only run for 16 weeks, the effect of a 10ppb increase on weekly \gls{o3} mean concentrations on risk of clubfoot was strongest two weeks before pregnancy and decreased linearly as the pregnancy progressed to the end of the first trimester. The effect of a 10ppb increase on weekly \gls{o3} peak concentrations on risk of clubfoot was strongest in week 2 of pregnancy (RR 1.02, 95% CI >1.00 to 1.04) and decreased linearly as the pregnancy progressed to the end of the first trimester (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-0.97 to <1.00). 
The effect of a 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} mean concentration on clubfoot was curved with the highest effect in week 11, after the earliest 13 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. The effect of a 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} peak concentration on clubfoot was wavy with the highest effects in week 5 of pregnancy and the lowest effect in week 7 of pregnancy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to <1.00), after the earliest 9 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. See Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:rrcf16g) for full results.
-->

In the 300 meter buffer evaluations with all lags, the effect of \gls{o3} on the risk of clubfoot was highest before conception for all evaluations. The effect of weekly \gls{pm25} mean concentrations was highest in week 8 of pregnancy for the 12-week evaluation and in week 12 of pregnancy for the 16-week evaluation. The effect of weekly \gls{pm25} peak concentrations was highest in weeks 2 to 3 of pregnancy for the 12-week evaluation and in weeks 7 to 8 of pregnancy for the 16-week evaluation.

\textbf{Cleft lip with or without cleft palate} 
\end{flushleft}

<!-- remove iterative results
In the stepwise elimination evaluations, cleft \lcp was evaluated over both 12 weeks and 16 weeks. For \gls{o3}, in the 12-week evaluation, the effects of a 10ppb increase of weekly \gls{o3} concentrations were very similar between mean \gls{o3} and peak \gls{o3}. The effects of both were lowest one month before pregnancy (mean RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.97-0.98; peak RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97) and highest the week before pregnancy (mean RR 1.05-1.06, 95% CI >1.00 to 1.11; peak RR 1.03-1.04, 95% CI >1.00 to 1.07), then flattened out for most of the evaluation period until reducing again at the end of the second month of pregnancy. In the 16-week evaluation, the effects of a 10ppb increase in weekly \gls{o3} mean concentration started high at week 7 of pregnancy, reduced in week 8, then leveled off for weeks 9 through 11 before increasing again at the end of the first trimester, after the earliest 11 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. The effects of a 10ppb increase in weekly \gls{o3} peak concentration began low a month before pregnancy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.98), then increased until week 1 of pregnancy (RR 1.03-1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.06), reduced steadily until the end of the second month of pregnancy, and increased again until the end of the first trimester.

For \gls{pm25}, the effect of a 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} mean concentration on the risk of cleft \lcp increased from the second to last week of the evaluation until the end of the evaluation in both the 12-week and 16-week evaluations, after the preceding weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 12-week evaluation, the effect of 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} peak concentration on the risk of cleft \lcp was curved, with the lowest effect in week 7 of pregnancy, after the earliest 9 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 16-week evaluation, the effect of 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} peak concentration on the risk of cleft \lcp was similar to the effect of mean \gls{pm25}, with the lowest effect in week 11 of pregnancy, after the earliest 11 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. See Supplementary Tables \@ref(tab:rrclp12g) and \@ref(tab:rrclp16g) for full results. 
-->

In the 300 meter buffer evaluations with all lags, the effect of \gls{o3} on the risk of cleft \lcps was highest around conception for all evaluations, and all of the weeks of highest effect were significant. The effect of weekly \gls{pm25} mean concentrations was consistently low for all evaluations. The effect of weekly \gls{pm25} peak concentrations was highest in weeks 1 to 2 of pregnancy for the 12-week evaluation and consistently low for the 16-week evaluation.

In the stepwise elimination evaluations, cleft palate was evaluated over both 12 and 16 weeks. For \gls{o3}, in the 12-week evaluation, the effect of a 10ppb increase of weekly \gls{o3} mean concentration on the risk of cleft palate was highest in week 7 of pregnancy, after the earliest 11 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 16-week evaluation, the effect of a 10ppb increase of weekly \gls{o3} mean concentration on the risk of cleft palate had a wavy shape, with the lowest effect at the end of the first trimester and the highest effect in week 11 of pregnancy, after the earliest 8 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 12-week evaluation, the effect of a 10ppb increase of weekly \gls{o3} peak concentration on the risk of cleft palate had a wavy shape, with the lowest effect in week 4 of pregnancy and the highest effect in the week of conception, after the earliest 3 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 16-week evaluation, the effect of a 10ppb increase of weekly \gls{o3} peak concentration on the risk of cleft palate had a wavy shape, with the lowest effect in weeks 4 to 5 of pregnancy (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.93 to <1.00) and the highest effect in week 1 of pregnancy, after the earliest 5 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. 

For \gls{pm25}, in the 12-week evaluation, the effect of a 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} mean concentration on the risk of cleft palate was linear and increased from a month before conception (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99) to the end of the evaluation. In the 16-week evaluation, the effect of a 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} mean concentration on the risk of cleft palate was curved, with the lowest effect two weeks before conception (RR 0.95-0.97, 95% CI 0.90-0.94 to 0.99-<1.00) and the highest effects in weeks 5 to 7 of pregnancy, after the earliest 2 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 12-week evaluation, the effect of 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} peak concentration on the risk of cleft palate was linear and increased from 2 weeks before conception to the end of the evaluation, after the earliest 2 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 16-week evaluation, the effect of a 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} peak concentration on the risk of cleft palate was curved, with the lowest effect in week 12 of pregnancy and the highest effects in weeks 7 to 8 of pregnancy, after the earliest 6 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative.

\textbf{Craniosynostosis} 
\end{flushleft}

<!-- remove iterative results
Craniosynostosis was evaluated over both 12 and 16 weeks. For \gls{o3}, in the 12-week evaluation, the effect of a 10ppb increase of weekly \gls{o3} mean concentration on the risk of craniosynostosis started higher in week 2 of pregnancy, decreased to its lowest in week 3 of pregnancy (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.99), and increased again to its highest in week 7 of pregnancy (RR 1.09-1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.18-1.19), after the earliest 6 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 16-week evaluation, the effect of a 10ppb increase of weekly \gls{o3} mean concentration on the risk of craniosynostosis had a wavy shape, with the lowest effect in week 5 of pregnancy (RR 0.86-0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99-<1.00) and the highest effect in week 6 of pregnancy (RR 1.20-1.21, 95% CI 1.08-1.09 to 1.33-1.34), after the earliest 9 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 12-week evaluation, the effect of a 10ppb increase of weekly \gls{o3} peak concentration on the risk of craniosynostosis had a wavy shape, with the lowest effect in week 4 of pregnancy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99) and the highest effect in week 7 of pregnancy (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15), after the earliest 4 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 16-week evaluation, the effect of a 10ppb increase of weekly \gls{o3} peak concentration on the risk of craniosynostosis had a curved shape, with the lowest effect in week 12 of pregnancy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.99) and the highest effects in weeks 7 to 8 of pregnancy (RR 1.04, 95% CI >1.00 to 1.07), after the earliest 7 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. 

For \gls{pm25}, in the 12-week evaluation, the effect of a 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} mean concentration on the risk of craniosynostosis was curved, with the lowest effect in week 5 of pregnancy and the highest effect in week 7 of pregnancy, after the earliest 9 weeks were removed from the model as non-informative. In the 16-week evaluation, the effect of a 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} mean concentration on the risk of craniosynostosis was wavy, with the highest effect one week before conception (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.28-1.29) and the lowest effect in week 5 of pregnancy, then throughout the pregnancy, the risk leveled out. In the 12-week evaluation, the effect of 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} peak concentration on the risk of craniosynostosis was wavy, with the lowest effect three weeks before conception and the highest effect one week before conception (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.03 to 1.18), then throughout the pregnancy, the risk leveled out, after the earliest week was removed from the model as non-informative. In the 16-week evaluation, the effect of a 10\ugm increase in weekly \gls{pm25} peak concentration on the risk of craniosynostosis was curved, with the lowest effect in week 8 of pregnancy and the highest effect in week 11 of pregnancy, after the earliest weeks were removed from the model as non-informative.

In the 300 meter buffer evaluations with all lags, the effect of weekly \gls{o3} mean concentrations on the risk of craniosynostosis was highest in week 8 of pregnancy for the 12-week evaluation and weeks 8 to 9 for the 16-week evaluation. The effect of weekly \gls{o3} peak concentrations was highest in week 8 of pregnancy for the 12-week evaluation and weeks 3 to 5 for the 16-week evaluation. The effect of weekly \gls{pm25} concentrations was highest before conception for all evaluations, with significant results for weekly \gls{pm25} mean concentrations in the 16 week evaluation.

## Discussion


This study proposed that green space has an effect on the relationship between select measures of air pollution and select birth defects. Results varied by evaluation (12 or 16 week), case group, and air pollution measure. Overall, there was no cumulative association between air pollution and birth defects in any of the evaluations, but some weeks were associated with the birth defects of interest. 

Green space is poorly studied in birth defects research. Research available suggested green space has a protective effect against heart defects as measured using the \gls{ndvi} at 500 meter and 1000 meter buffers, with results consistent across both buffers.[@Nie2020] Consistent with that study, critical weeks (weeks in which an association was present) tended to be consistent across buffers and green space measures, suggesting that in most cases, buffer size does not affect the associations between case groups and air pollutant measures. Because results were similar across buffers, results here focus on the 300 meter buffer. 


### Clubfoot

The higher effect of a 10-unit increase of \gls{o3} on clubfoot around conception suggest clubfoot risk is affected more by pre-conception exposure to \gls{o3}. The higher effect of a 10-unit increase of mean \gls{pm25} in the second and third months of pregnancy suggest clubfoot risk is affected more by exposure to mean \gls{pm25} during the critical window of development. The higher effect of a 10-unit increase of peak \gls{pm25} in the first and second months of pregnancy suggest clubfoot risk is affected more by exposure to peak \gls{pm25} just before and during the critical window of development. Results were consistent for both green space measures, suggesting the inclusion of water with green space did not affect clubfoot risk. 

<!-- Most of the birth outcomes research containing multiple buffers, including buffers at 50m and 100m, showed effects from green space only on smaller buffers.[@Tvina2021; @Abelt2017; @Dzhambov2019; @TorresToda2020; @Markevych2014; @Laurent2013; @Grazuleviciene2015; @Dadvand2014; @Cusack2018; @Agay-Shay2014] However, all of these studies used the \gls{ndvi}, which does not separate trees from other green space. One study containing a 100m buffer used the \gls{nlcd} and found that green space was protective against preterm birth in all buffers 250m and below.[@Tvina2021]  -->

The lack of strong associations between the air pollutant measures and clubfoot was consistent with equivalent results without green space, suggesting that green space does not affect the relationship between these measures and clubfoot. In general, weekly risk ratios were consistent with equivalent results without green space, and any differences were tiny. Results were consistent for both green space measures. Overall, the association between clubfoot and air pollution was not affected by green space. 

<!-- The association between peak \gls{o3} and clubfoot was consistent across all buffers for both measures of green space. Research on birthweight has also found that critical weeks remain consistent across buffers.[@Agay-Shay2014; @Grazuleviciene2015; @TorresToda2020] The critical second week was consistent with the equivalent model prior to adding green space, with the same risk ratios, suggesting that green space does not affect the relationship between \gls{o3} peak exposure and clubfoot.  -->

<!-- There were no strong associations between \gls{pm25} mean exposure and clubfoot in any buffers. This is consistent with the results without green space, which also showed no strong associations. The association between peak \gls{pm25} and clubfoot was consistent across all buffers for both measures of green space, consistent with the results without green space. From these results, we concluded that green space does not affect the relationship between \gls{pm25}, whether peak or mean measures, and clubfoot.  -->


### Cleft lip with or without cleft palate

The increased effect of a 10-unit increase of \gls{o3} on cleft \lcps risk around conception suggest cleft \lcps risk is affected more by exposure to \gls{o3} in early pregnancy. The effect of a 10-unit increase of mean \gls{pm25} on cleft \lcps risk was consistently low. The effect of a 10-unit increase of peak \gls{pm25} on cleft \lcps risk was consistently low in the 16-week evaluation, but highest in the first month of pregnancy in the 12-week evaluation, suggesting cleft \lcps risk is affected more by exposure to \gls{o3} in early pregnancy. Results were consistent for both green space measures, suggesting the inclusion of water with green space did not affect cleft \lcps risk. 

The lack of strong associations between the air pollutant measures and cleft \lcps was consistent with equivalent results without green space, suggesting that green space does not affect the relationship between these measures and cleft \lcp. In general, weekly risk ratios were consistent with equivalent results without green space. The largest differences between the evaluations were for \gls{o3}, for which some of the low risk ratios were lower than in the evaluation without green space and some of the high risk ratios were higher than in the evaluation without green space. Results were consistent for both green space measures. Overall, the association between cleft \lcps and \gls{o3} may have been affected by green space, but the association between cleft \lcps and \gls{pm25} was not affected by green space. 

<!-- The association between mean \gls{o3} and cleft \lcp during the month before pregnancy for both measures of green space in all buffers was strong in the 16-week evaluation, but not the 12-week evaluation, is consistent with the results without green space, suggesting green space has no effect on the relationship between \gls{o3} mean exposure and cleft lip with or without cleft palate. The association between peak \gls{o3} and cleft \lcp risk for both measures of green space in all buffers was strong throughout the 16-week evaluation, but only prior to conception in the 12-week evaluation, consistent with the results without green space, but exact weeks with increased effect varied slightly. Green space appears to have some effect on the relationship between \gls{o3} peak exposure and cleft \lcp in the 12-week evaluation, but a minor effect in the 16-week evaluation. -->



### Cleft palate

The increased effect of a 10-unit increase of mean \gls{o3} on cleft palate risk around conception suggest cleft palate risk is affected more by exposure to mean \gls{o3} in early pregnancy. The increased effect of a 10-unit increase of peak \gls{o3} on cleft palate risk at the end of the second and third months of pregnancy suggest cleft palate risk is affected more by exposure to peak \gls{o3} around the end of the critical window. The increased effect of a 10-unit increase of \gls{pm25} on cleft palate risk during the second month of pregnancy suggest cleft palate risk is affected more by exposure to \gls{pm25} during the critical window. Results were consistent for both green space measures, suggesting the inclusion of water with green space did not affect cleft palate risk. 

The lack of strong associations between \gls{o3} and cleft palate was consistent with equivalent results without green space, suggesting that green space does not affect the relationship between \gls{o3} and cleft palate. The strong associations between \gls{pm25} and cleft palate only up to conception was consistent with equivalent results without green space, suggesting that green space does not affect the relationship between \gls{pm25} and cleft palate. In general, weekly risk ratios were consistent with equivalent results without green space. Results were consistent for both green space measures. Overall, the association between cleft palate and air pollution was not affected by green space.

<!-- There were no strong associations between \gls{o3} exposure and cleft palate in any buffers for both results with green space and results without green space. The association between peak \gls{o3} and cleft palate around conception for both measures of green space varied across buffers, with some buffers including 5 weeks and others including 12 weeks. Some buffers were consistent with the results without green space, suggesting green space has some effect on the relationship between \gls{o3} peak exposure and cleft palate. -->

<!-- The association between mean \gls{pm25} and cleft palate around conception for both measures of green space was consistent across buffers, consistent with the results without green space, suggesting green space has no effect on the relationship between \gls{pm25} mean exposure and cleft palate. The association between peak \gls{pm25} and cleft palate around conception for both measures of green space was consistent across buffers, consistent with the results without green space, suggesting green space has no effect on the relationship between \gls{pm25} peak exposure and cleft palate. Overall, the relationship with cleft palate possibly affected by green space was with \gls{o3} peak exposure.  -->


### Craniosynostosis


The increased effect of a 10-unit increase of mean \gls{o3} on craniosynostosis risk at the end of the second month of pregnancy suggest craniosynostosis risk is affected more by exposure to mean \gls{o3} toward the end of the critical window. The increased effect of a 10-unit increase of peak \gls{o3} on craniosynostosis risk before conception and during the first and second months of pregnancy suggest craniosynostosis risk is affected by exposure to peak \gls{o3} before and in the early part of pregnancy, including during the critical window. The increased effect of a 10-unit increase of \gls{pm25} on craniosynostosis risk around conception suggest craniosynostosis risk is affected more by exposure to \gls{pm25} in early pregnancy. Results were consistent for both green space measures, suggesting the inclusion of water with green space did not affect cleft palate risk. 

The lack of strong associations between \gls{o3} and craniosynostosis was consistent with equivalent results without green space, suggesting that green space does not affect the relationship between \gls{o3} and craniosynostosis. The strong associations between \gls{pm25} and craniosynostosis only up to conception was consistent with equivalent results without green space, suggesting that green space does not affect the relationship between \gls{pm25} and craniosynostosis. In general, weekly risk ratios were consistent with equivalent results without green space. The largest differences between the evaluations were for \gls{pm25}, for which several risk ratios, including the lowest and highest ones, were higher than in the evaluation without green space. Results were consistent for both green space measures. Overall, the association between craniosynostosis and \gls{pm25} may have been affected by green space, but the association between craniosynostosis and \gls{o3} was not affected by green space. 

<!-- The association between mean \gls{pm25} and craniosynostosis around conception for both measures of green space was not consistent across buffers, with stronger associations in smaller buffers. Several studes using the \gls{ndvi} showed effects from green space only on smaller buffers.[@Tvina2021; @Abelt2017; @Dzhambov2019; @TorresToda2020; @Markevych2014; @Laurent2013; @Grazuleviciene2015; @Dadvand2014; @Cusack2018; @Agay-Shay2014] This was not consistent with the results without green space, suggesting green space has an effect on the relationship between \gls{pm25} mean exposure and craniosynostosis. The association between peak \gls{pm25} and craniosynostosis around conception for both measures of green space was consistent across buffers, mostly consistent with the results without green space, suggesting green space has a slight effect on the relationship between \gls{pm25} peak exposure and craniosynostosis. Overall, the relationships between \gls{pm25} and craniosynostosis were possibly affected by green space.  -->



### Strengths and limitations

Strengths of this study included that birth defect cases covered fourteen years and most of \gls{nys}. Birth defects studied are well-diagnosed, so case misclassification is unlikely, and a sensitivity analysis of the one birth defect known to have misclassification issues was not significant. Air pollutant exposure was available daily and residential information was available at point level for most births, allowing greater granularity both temporally and spatially than many currently published studies. The \gls{nlcd} data covered the entire state at a small enough resolution to see variation even within 50 meter buffers and classified trees separately from grasses to allow for them to be analyzed separately.


Limitations of this study include possible exposure misclassification that is presumed to be non-differential, which would bias results toward the null. Air pollutant exposures were assigned based on the mother's geocoded residence at birth, but no information was available regarding the mother's activity patterns, including how much time she spent at that residence during her pregnancy, so we cannot assess if assigned exposures are an accurate reflection of actual exposures. However, a sensitivity test of geocoding results showed no issues when ungeocoded births were assigned to \gls{zip} code centroids and research suggests that mothers who move during pregnancy tend to move to areas with similar levels of air pollution.[@Lupo2009] In \gls{nys}, smoking is known to be under-reported on birth certificates[@Roohan2003], but even with presumed non-differential under-reporting, mothers of cases reported smoking more frequently than mothers of controls. Income is based on median census tract income, but the mother's household may have an income much higher or lower than the median in her census tract of residence, which could bias results toward the null. 




## Conclusion

In conclusion, green space may affect the relationship between \gls{o3} and cleft \lcps and the relationship between \gls{pm25} and craniosynostosis. More research is needed on the relationship between green space and birth defects, and their association with air pollution, especially cleft \lcps and craniosynostosis.

#' Draw a forest plot of air pollutant by green space
#'
#' @param data        Dataset of model settings, including lag RRs and CIs.
#' @param defect_abbr Abbreviation for birth defect to be plotted, from the
#'                    dataset.
#' @param lags        Maximum number of lags in the model.
#' @param defect_name Full name of the defect, for the graph title.

#' @description
#' This function reads in a table with risk ratios and confidence intervals by
#' lag to be plotted on a graph, then calls `draw_forest_plot()` to
#' create two ggplot objects (one for mean concentrations and one for peaks)
#' and uses a grob function to combine them into one figure.
